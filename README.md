# Demand Prediction Project

This project is a demand forecasting model designed to predict daily sales for retail stores. Using machine learning, the project leverages historical sales data to predict future demand, aiding in efficient stock management and reducing costs associated with overstocking or understocking.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Rossmann Store Sales** dataset (or another popular demand prediction dataset) to train the demand forecasting model. The dataset includes:
- Store information, sales, and promotional data
- Date-based features like day of the week, holiday information, and other calendar attributes

The dataset is stored in the `data/raw/` folder, and preprocessed data is saved in `data/processed/`.
